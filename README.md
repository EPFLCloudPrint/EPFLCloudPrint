# EPFLCloudPrint
#### A simple web service to bring remote printing to handheld devices.
This project was created to be able to send files to EPFL's printing pool from mobile phones and tablets. It is also an alternative way to print from your computer without having to install the printer's driver.
It's uses aren't limited to our university but can be ported to any company or university server, so users can print from any browser.

This project was originally developed during Facebook Hackathon 2014 organized by Hackers@EPFL (http://hackersatepfl.com).
